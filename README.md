### Hi 👋, I'm Nikita Shkaruba

There are some facts about me:

- 👾 Currently I'm working at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company) (Since 2021), and previously I worked at [VKontakte](https://vk.com/about) for 5 years
- 🤖 I'm pretty good at `Go`, `Systems design`, and specialize in `Backend development`
- 🔨 I know bunch about `React` and `PHP`, and tried every possible production programming language
- ❤️ I love English, Leetcoding, Therapy, and my family
- ⚡ Fun fact: In the past I was into YouTube and I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxjRJZmis&list=PLK2wVyb-VU2rtNVTmfVzJanTgnLUqEo_V) with 800k likes. Also I did music, but it's too cringe to show
